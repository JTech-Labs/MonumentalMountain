# Items
This file is for reference purposes only and is used to document all the items and the punctuation system of the main game

---

MonumentalMountain uses a punctuation system that edits the status variables depending on what is in the inventory. This document is purely to note down what each item does, so the devs can keep track and the players can use it as a reference point. If you have any questions, please open an issue.
