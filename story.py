 A path directly ahead of you leads to a giant grey, snow-capped mountain shrouded by clouds\
 which half hides the bright sun. To the right there is a path leading to a green and\
 life-filled forest. The treetops are shrouded by storm clouds and a dark atmosphere\
 emanates from it. The left path leads to a barren and arid desert with a few littered\
 canyons and scorching heat that can be felt even from here.",

You slowly stroll forwards, brushing the sand with your feet as the sun scorches the back of your neck. \
You see a set of large rocks that look like could be good for refuge and might be a bit humid. \
You can also see a small shadow far away and think it could be an oasis. \
Or you could carry on forwards just incase you find anything better. Remember, you can always \"Go back\"."
