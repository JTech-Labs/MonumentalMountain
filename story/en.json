A path directly ahead of you leads to a giant grey, snow-capped mountain shrouded by clouds which half hides the bright sun. To the right there is a path leading to a green and life-filled forest. The treetops are shrouded by storm clouds and a dark atmosphere emanates from it. The left path leads to a barren and arid desert with a few littered canyons and scorching heat that can be felt even from here.",

You slowly stroll forwards, brushing the sand with your feet as the sun scorches the back of your neck. You see a set of large rocks to the left that look like could be good for refuge and might be a bit humid. You can also see a small shadow far off to the right and think it could be an oasis. Or you could carry on forwards just incase you find anything better.",

            "Desert Shadow": "After some walking, you find a palm tree with an \"X\" carved into it, as this had always meant treasure in your world, you dig a few centimeters and find a small coin, when you go to touch it, a surge of power ruches through you as you feel an increase of energy traveling through you body. Now you can only go backwards.",

You discover that its name in Inorilarn, the long forgoten language of this land, and that it has been here since the first ray of light dried the sandy place. He hasn't talked to anyone in a lot of time as most adventurers are too terrified. The Cocroach gifts you a few presents, thanking you from seeing th beauty in him, and dissapears to protect another land...",
