# MonumentalMountain
This is a simply written "choose your own story" style RPG text adventure game made in Python and inspired by the 1976's Colossal Cave Adventure.

## Writing and licensing

This program is written by high schoolers in our spare time so please be respectful if updates take some time to be released. The Python files are compiled into executables with [Nuitka](https://nuitka.net) using the respective OS. All the code is licensed under GNU GPL v3.0.

## Releases

For the downloads please go to the [*`refs`*](https://git.sr.ht/~jtech-labs/MonumentalMountain/refs) section of the repo, choose the tag you want to download from (the latest one is recommended), and just download run the executable for your respective OS. Alpha releases will be codenamed `"Quantum Rock"`, Beta releases will be codenamed `"Small Stone"`, and Stable releases will have their own codename.

___Releases, updates and other changes or news will be recorded on the [`~jtech-labs/monumentalmountain-announce@lists.sr.ht](https://lists.sr.ht/~jtech-labs/monumentalmountain-announce) mailing list.___

From v0.0.2 the way the code worked and was organised got remade which will help boost development speed. The v0.0.2Alpha-r is the same as previous just replaced with the new code format. All packages before v0.0.2Alpha-r where made with [pyInstaller](https://pyinstaller.org), all packeges after this one are make with [Nuitka](https://nuitka.net).
