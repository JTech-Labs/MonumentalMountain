# Intro
This file is for reference purposes only and is used to document all the Features, Bosses, NPCs, Items and the basic system of the main game

---

MonumentalMountain uses several systems to keep track of Bosses, NPCs, the player Inventory and several other stats. Most use dictionaries, variables or lists. This document is purely to note down what each thing does and is, so the devs can keep track and the players can use it as a reference point. If you have any questions, please open an issue.

## Stats
Stats are different values that tell you about how your character is.

- Inventory

## Items
These are the things that are added to your inventory, they can give you buffs (Power Ups) and have special uses. There are several rarity levels out of 100. The higher the rarity, the better the item (normally).

### Multi-Use
These Items you can pick up and use as many times as you want (if it can be used), the buffs they give you are only applicable while you have it. You can drop it and pick it back up from where you first found it.

__*!!ATTENTION!!*__ If for example you have an item that buffs you ten points and then you drop the item when you have less than this e.g. 9HP, then you will still lose the same amount you gained when you picked it up, so you will die. So be careful. Overall, it is a beter idea not to drop Multi-Use items, specially if you have very low stats.

* Compass -> Lvl - 3.Gives you tips on the best move available. Although it sometimes might tell you a bit of information, and can always just not say anything at any given place.
* Coin -> Lvl - 1. Buffs: +2 Health, +2 Protection and +1 Magic. A small golden disk ressembling what you know as a coin, belonging to a long forgoten civilication. It holds a special power and a surge of positive, warm energy shoot up your body when you touch it
* Wand -> Lvl - 80. Buffs: +50 Health, +50 Protection, +90 Power, +30 Magic

### Single-Use
These Items you can pick up and use only once (mostly single boosts, like food or potions). You can drop these but they will break on the floor and you won't be able to get it back.

- Bread Loaf -> Buffs: +5 Health, +2 Power
